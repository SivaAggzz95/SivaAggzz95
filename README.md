### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**SivaAggzz95/SivaAggzz95** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Kotlin
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning TS
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on cool android open-source libraries/projects
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: sivaaggzz@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: Developed a launcher with 990K+ installs but Google turned down on it :D and the journeys still continues
